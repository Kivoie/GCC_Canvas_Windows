# GCC_Canvas_Windows
_Compile and run C/C++ files in Windows CMD or Powershell (GNU Compiler for Windows is a prerequisite)_

Ignored files include, but are not limited to, executables (`.exe`), C and CPP files (`.c`, `.cpp`), and the `logs/` directory. Check the `.gitignore` for further details.

`gcc_prompt` and `g++_prompt` are batch files that provide a simple command line-based interface for compiling and running your C/CPP files.
These two files will work on Windows 10 as of `version 1909`.
